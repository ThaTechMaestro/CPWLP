# Background Story

* I have always been trying to understand some low level concepts which involves the inner workings of a compiler or an interpreter.

* Another journey of asking questions I embarked on was "How does the Linux shell work under the hood?"

* I could read articles and articles and be filled with theoretical knowledge or roll up my sleeves and start tinkering with pieces of code that makes up a typical shell hence gaining a deeper understanding.

* This repo makes it obvious I took the latter option. As I researched more, C/C++ tends to be a major reference. Most codes involving concepts which explains how things work under the hood were written in this language. So here I am picking it up.

* C seems to be a bedrock to some modern programming languages.

* Chose this course, it provides an intersection of C and the Linux OS. It lays a great foundation on which I can build on and crucial in helping me find answers to my never ending questions.

## Overview

* It is a specialization course made up of seven courses.

* The folders are named after each course.

* Each folder represents a particular course which contains solutions to the individual exercises (activity) associated with each course.

* Completed final projects can be found in the **z_final_project** folder for each course.

* My thought process, questions I asked myself, important concepts analyzed at a deeper level which might have been helpful in the completion of the projects or provided an answer to one my many "why or how does it work" questions can be found in the **documentation.txt**

* Copy my **.gitignore** to prevent pushing compiled c files to your repo.

## Language

* C

## Operating System
* Linux 


## Goal

* Develop a foundational knowledge base in C.

* Develop an understanding of the inner workings of a Linux OS.

* Analyze codes which performs specific functions written in C on the Linux OS.

* Develop a deeper understanding of core concepts implemented in the Linux Operating System which are achieved with the help of C.

* Build and Break things,  hopefully I fix them.
