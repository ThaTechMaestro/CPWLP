Worked on the output statement, The result specified should be in 1 decimal place
  Made use of format specifier

  printf("you rolled: %d, current average: %d", );

Why scanf() takes the ampersand value(&)
    In programming

    int a = 3

    Understanding how int a = 3 is stored in memory

    The scanf does not take an ampersand value
    rather it takes a pointer to a location in memory

    scanf("%d", &counter);
    In our case a pointer to the location where a variable being referenced by "counter"
      is stored can also be accesed by its memory address.

    The ampersand value returns the memory address of the set of memory created by the 
      reference variable "counter". The input read from the scanf function takes this input
      and stores in the memory location being pointed to by the memory address specified.

-----------------------------------------------
Converting an int data type to a double data type
  Explicity specified the double data type.
  It is referred to as type casting
