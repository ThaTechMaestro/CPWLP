Worked on the output statement, The result specified
Made use of format specifier

  printf("you rolled: %d, current average: %d", );


Numeric values of program output should be in one decimal place.

-----------------------------------------
Why scanf() takes the ampersand value(&)
    In programming

    int a = 3

    Space is created based on the max number of values 
        int valued variable
