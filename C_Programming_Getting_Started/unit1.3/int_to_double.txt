#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)

{
  int numberOfGrades;
  int grades;
  int  total;

    scanf("%d", &numberOfGrades);

    for(int i = 0; i < numberOfGrades; i++){

      scanf("%d", &grades);
      printf("%d\n",grades);
      printf("%d\n",total);

      


    }

    
    return 0;
}

 While solving this exercise, I came across something very interesting
 
 It was a mistake at first but found out it was a concept in c.

 total is defined but not assigned any variable.
 But on printing it out, it gave an output containing the value entered for grades and a
    set of random values. Each on a new line

    For an Input of:
    2
    4 (first value)

    An Output of:
    4 (value of the grades)
    4 (value for total)
    234323 (random value for total)
